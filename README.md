# farris-laundry

## Objective
Create an app to track the amount of time left on loads on laundry in farris

## Finite Goals
Create QR codes that will be posted on each washer for people to easily "Claim" their laundry
Have cameras set up on each of the washers and driers that read the seven segment displays
Send the information read by the cameras to the backend
Create mobile application for people to easily navigate to the site
Create web application? (Doesn't really serve a purpose if there is a mobile app, but I feel it is necessary nonetheless
Hook up raspberry pi server in both of the laundry rooms
